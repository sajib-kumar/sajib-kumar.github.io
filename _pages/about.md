Welcome!!!

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I am Sajib Kumar Saha Joy, a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="http://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)</a> in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I hold a BSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the same <a href="https://www.aust.edu/cse">institution</a>. It brings me immense joy and pride to be able to serve my alma mater as an educator. My primary research interests revolve around Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
<br /><br />
In the realm of NLP, I am driven to explore novel techniques for language understanding, generation, and sentiment analysis. My research goals encompass the development of more sophisticated and context-aware language models that can accurately interpret human language and generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Furthermore, I am intrigued by the challenge of multilingual NLP and cross-lingual transfer learning, aiming to build models that can effectively process multiple languages and facilitate seamless communication across linguistic boundaries. Additionally, I seek to contribute to the ethical application of NLP technologies, addressing bias and fairness concerns to ensure that NLP systems promote inclusivity and social good. In the field of Computer Vision, my research endeavors revolve around advancing visual perception and recognition systems. I am enthusiastic about developing state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that can accurately classify and detect objects, scenes, and activities within images and videos. My interests also lie in exploring visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning, enabling machines to comprehend visual content and answer questions or describe images in natural language. Furthermore, I am keen on investigating ways to improve the interpretability and explainability of deep learning models in Computer Vision, as this is crucial for building trust and understanding the decision-making process of these complex systems. Ultimately, my research is not limited to theoretical advancements but is also driven by the goal of applying NLP and Computer Vision technologies to address real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in exploring the applications of these techniques in areas such as healthcare, education, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction. By leveraging the capabilities of NLP and Computer Vision, I aim to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that positively impact society and improve the quality of life for individuals around the world.
<br /><br />
As an individual, I strive to be a quick learner and maintain honesty and integrity in all my endeavors. I believe in the power of hard work and continuous improvement to achieve my goals. My thirst for knowledge fuels my desire to develop advanced skills in my field. Ultimately, I aspire to be a successful research scientist in the domain of computer science and contribute to the betterment of society and the world through my work. My guiding philosophy centers around making a positive impact on society and the world. I am dedicated to using my skills and knowledge for the greater good, and I value integrity, empathy, and ethical conduct in everything I do.
<br /><br />
At present, I am actively engaged in multiple research projects that align with my interests and expertise. Detailed information about the ongoing projects can be found on the <a href="https://sajib-kumar.github.io/projects/">project page</a>.
<br /><br />
My long-term goal is to establish myself as a successful researcher in the field of NLP and Computer Vision, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in understanding and processing both language and visual information. I am dedicated to collaborating with fellow researchers and industry experts to drive innovation and create AI systems that are not only advanced and accurate but also ethical and inclusive.  I also aspire to be a mentor and supervisor for students, guiding them in their academic and research pursuits in a supportive and nurturing manner.
